### Premise

- Game starts in bed, and the environment should mirror the apartment
  - Stuffies, tables, bed, chairs, kitchen, etc. should all mirror the actual apartment
- Environment should have collision and be interactive
  - Possible interactions should be indicated by a little symbol above the character's head
  - Walls, tables, etc. cannot be walked through
- Interactions display an image of what is being interacted with as well as a text box with flavour text
- Once player heads to the door, battle starts
  - Player has a sleeping baby psyduck with 4 moves with 1PP each
  - Enemy has 4 psyduck variants that are all 1 hit KO'd
- After battle + flavour text is done, mini valentine card pops up
